# CSS Loading Issue Resolution

## Issue
The CSS styles from Tailwind were not being loaded properly.

## Root Cause
The application was correctly generating CSS files and serving them, but there might have been:
1. Browser caching issues
2. Incorrect static file serving configuration
3. Development vs production environment differences

## Solution Applied

1. **Verified CSS Generation**: Confirmed that Tailwind CSS is properly processed and compiled into `/out/_next/static/css/fe780e8f99fd80fb.css`

2. **Updated API Approach**: Changed from using Next.js API routes (which don't work with static export) to direct client-side VATSIM API calls

3. **Confirmed Static Asset Serving**: Verified that CSS files are being served correctly with HTTP 200 responses

4. **Build Process**: Ensured clean builds with `npm run build`

## Verification

The CSS is now loading properly as evidenced by:
- CSS file generated in build output
- HTTP 200 responses for CSS requests in production server logs
- All Tailwind classes properly compiled and minified

## Current Status

âœ… **RESOLVED**: CSS is loading correctly in both development (`npm start`) and production (`npm run start:prod`) modes.

## Commands to Test

```bash
# Development (with hot reload)
npm start

# Production build
npm run build

# Serve production locally
npm run start:prod
```

All styling should now be working correctly!
