# Airport Name Resolution Feature

## Overview
Added integration with VATSIM's Airport Information API to display full airport names alongside ICAO codes.

## Implementation

### API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `https://my.vatsim.net/api/v2/aip/airports/:icao`
- **Method**: GET
- **Authentication**: None required
- **CORS**: Enabled for browser requests

### Features
1. **Automatic Resolution**: When a flight is found, the app automatically fetches airport information for departure and arrival airports
2. **Caching**: Airport data is cached in component state to avoid duplicate API calls
3. **Graceful Fallback**: If airport name cannot be fetched, displays just the ICAO code
4. **Enhanced Display**: Shows format like "KJFK - John F Kennedy International Airport"

### Technical Details

#### TypeScript Interface
```typescript
export interface VatsimAirport {
  icao: string;
  name: string;
  city?: string;
  country?: string;
}
```

#### Key Functions
- `fetchAirportInfo(icao: string)`: Fetches airport data from VATSIM API
- `formatAirportDisplay(icao: string)`: Formats display string with code and name
- Caching mechanism prevents redundant API calls

#### API Response Structure
The VATSIM Airport API returns data in this format:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "icao": "KJFK",
    "iata": "JFK", 
    "name": "John F Kennedy International Airport",
    "city": "New York, New York",
    "country": "United States",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Important**: The actual airport data is nested under the `data` property.

#### Error Handling
- Network errors are logged but don't break the main flight lookup
- Missing airport data gracefully falls back to showing just the ICAO code
- Non-blocking implementation ensures flight data displays even if airport lookup fails

## Benefits
- **User-Friendly**: Makes airport information more accessible to users unfamiliar with ICAO codes
- **Professional**: Provides complete airport information like professional flight tracking systems
- **Performance**: Efficient caching reduces API calls and improves response times
- **Reliable**: Graceful fallbacks ensure the app always works even if airport data is unavailable

## Example Output
- **Before**: `Departure: KJFK`, `Arrival: KLAX`
- **After**: `Departure: KJFK - John F Kennedy International Airport`, `Arrival: KLAX - Los Angeles International Airport`
